# Sustainer Resources

We hear often that convincing the powers that be in companies to sustainably support open source is not easy. We still need to work together as a community towards a common understanding of what sustainability means and the role companies should have in this ecosystem but in the meantime, we can also make progress.  We acknowledge that there are many heroes insisde companies who are fighting for this and we want to support them. This is an open toolkit for sustainers to use to make the case internally for their companies to support their open source stack.
